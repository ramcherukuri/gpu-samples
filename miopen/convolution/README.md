This code is ported from  http://www.goldsborough.me/cuda/ml/cudnn/c++/2017/10/01/14-37-23-convolutions_with_cudnn/

Test code uses OpenCV to open and save images. 

Install opencv on Ubuntu 18.04 

sudo apt install libopencv-dev 

To build and run 

make
./conv ./mario.png

The output image will save as out.png.
